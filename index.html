                    <div class="project-content">
                            <p>For my Master's Thesis, I explored how competitive gamification can enhance engagement and collaboration within virtual teams. <br> <br> 

                            Traditional security training is often perceived as dry and unengaging. To address this, I developed a Unity-based virtual office simulation where remote team members collaborated to learn and execute cybersecurity protocols. <br> <br>

                            The prototype integrated competitive elements like leaderboards and NPCs to drive behavior. Through experimental research, I demonstrated that this approach not only reduced the psychological distance between team members but also significantly increased engagement with security training materials compared to traditional methods.

                                For this project, I analyzed the European Union's AI Act with a particular focus on
                                discrimination risks in AI-driven recruitment. Based on the findings, I developed policy

                                bridging the gap between regulation and organizational practice.

                                For my Business Analytics and Business Intelligence projects, I engaged in a variety of data-driven initiatives. 
                                For example, I conducted survey research to measure customer satisfaction and perception, utilizing statistical methods like Cronbach's Alpha for reliability analysis and structural equation modeling for validity. <br> <br>
                                I also designed and executed experimental studies, such as assessing the impact of AI-generated advertisement text on online ad clicks, which involved hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and ensuring experimental validity. <br> <br>
                                Additionally, I developed predictive models using logistic regression to forecast customer renewal decisions and employee turnover, enhancing the company's CRM strategies. <br> <br>
                                In another project, I processed large datasets using SQL for data cleaning and transformation, and created interactive dashboards in Tableau to visualize customer shopping trends and analyze the effectiveness of promotional strategies on sales. <br> <br>
                                To the right are some examples from these analytics projects: a BI dashboard created with Tableau, a two-factor Structural Equation Model (SEM), and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) model, presented in that order.

                            For this project, my study group and I redesigned the SG Smart lighting application to enhance its usability and user experience. <br> <br>
                            By conducting user research through surveys, interviews, and usability testing with methods like the System Usability Scale, we identified key areas for improvement. <br> <br>
                            We then developed iterative prototypes using Figma and Unity, focusing on simplifying navigation, improving visual hierarchy, and creating intuitive iconography. <br> <br>
                            Through this user-centered design approach, the final prototype significantly increased usability scores and received positive user feedback, demonstrating a substantial improvement in user satisfaction.

                        <p>Throughout my studies I've also been a part of developing various game systems and interactive 3D worlds. Examples of these include the following: <br> <br>
                            <span style="color: #dad7af; font-weight: bold;">Life Below Water: Spreading Awareness Through a Serious Game</span> <br>
                            For this project, my team and I developed a Unity-based 3D platformer aimed at children aged 9 to 12, focusing on the United Nations' "Life Below Water" global goal. <br> <br>
                            By conducting workshops with schoolchildren, we created an engaging game that educates players about marine conservation and the impacts of pollution. <br> <br>
                            Despite challenges due to COVID-19, we successfully combined fun gameplay with educational content to promote environmental awareness among young players. A trailer for the game can be seen in the video to the right. <br> <br>

                            <span style="color: #dad7af; font-weight: bold;">Castle Runners</span> <br>
                            In this project, we developed "Castle Runners," an endless runner and puzzle game that enhances player engagement through webcam-based head tracking. <br> <br>
                            By integrating computer vision techniques, players control the game using physical head movements, increasing accessibility without the need for specialized hardware. <br> <br>
                            Through user testing, we demonstrated that the head-tracking control scheme significantly improves player engagement compared to traditional controls. A preview of the development process can be seen in the video to the right.<br> <br>
